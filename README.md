Integrating the self/other with the interior/exterior involves more than can be allowed under the gracious auspices of our benefactors.
To cast aside the totalitarian rule of capitalism is to call forth all the demonic forces that are still latent in the world.
It would unleash the full ferocious and ravenous appetite of a stupid, blind, and dispassionate process who's infantile grasp we have only yet begun to crawl out of.
Does this world really mean so little to you?
